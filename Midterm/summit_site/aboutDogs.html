      <h4>Personality</h4>

      <p>
        These types of dogs are very playful and love to be around other dogs and
        people. They are very loving and are great with young children. They are
        true pack animals. These dogs are also highly adaptable to their enviorments.
      </p>

      <p>
        These dogs are also very loud. Alaskan dogs tend to bark and howl so they are not the best if you like it quiet.
        Though some may be loud you might get lucky and get a quiet one.
        Alaskan dogs are also jammed packed full of energy and are always playful.
        You will rarely see a moment where your dog will be lounging around.
      </p>

      <h4>Other Notes</h4>

      <p>
        Alaskan dogs are also a dual coat dog meaning that they will shed a lot.
        You should be prepared to brush your dog everynow and then when it is bad.
        They are also busy dogs, meaning they like to have things to do and rarely will not do anything at all.
        They like movement and taking them on runs or walks will be benificial for them.
