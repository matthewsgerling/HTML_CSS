        Training your dog will be challenging but following these couple of easy tips can make training your dog easy.
        <ol>
          <li>

            It is good to start at a young age and continue for a long while.
          </li>
          <li>
            They get bored: Remember that when training your dog that it will get bored after a long period of training.
            Take breaks and do it in moderation every other day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Declare right away who is that Alpha: Alaskan dogs have a higherarchy and they will stick to it. If they see you as
            lower in the pecking order they will not listen to you.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h4>Grooming</h4>
      <p>
        Alaskan dogs have a long coat of double layer, thick, long fur that will
        easily get caught, tangled and matted so brushing is essential. They tend to
        shed there fur many times a year so you will need to get it brushed and trimmed
        often.
      </p>

      <h4>Health and Nutrition</h4>
      <p>
        The type of food that you should feed your Alaskan dog may vary from dog to dog
        but one thing will be consistent. Make sure they are feed 2 to 3 times per day.
        These dogs are working dogs and will need food for the energy they burn.
      </p>
      <p>

        that also has some sort of veteable incorperated. You must make sure that
        they dont over eat or they will start to put on weight and get slower and lazier.
