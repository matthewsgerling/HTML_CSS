    About Me

  <article class="information">
    <p class="about">
      I grew up in a small town where everyone knew everyone. I was not originally
      from that area and we had moved in when I was around 7 or 8. I grew up doing
      many different extracurriculars. I played soccer all the way through high
      school and I still plan on playing more of it. I participated in our school band
      and I play the saxophone. I started coding in Java in the 7th grade and have only
      expanded my knowledge from there. I have in total learned Java, C++, C#, Python,
      and now I am learning HTML and CSS. I plan on in the future to go to the University of Utah
      to further my knowledge and hopefully get into a carreer as a game developer.
